Recently, clicking on the Office icon produced nothing but a blank page. There was no explanation given and little information available online other than reinstall Office 365. Having done this reinstall the individual office apps now open online rather than in the appropriate app and automatically save to OneDrive. After an hour of unsuccessfully trying to reverse this I am considering going elsewhere for these apps. Microsoft seems to be focussing on their needs not the ordinary customers'. For decades I have bought the latest version of Windows and Word, Excel etc., they must have a team just working on how to get more money out of their customers for the least amount of effort.(Translated)Recently, clicking on the Office icon produced nothing but a blank page.

Having everything in one place has its benefits, such as using both a home PC and a laptop or work computer elsewhere. However this is also inconvenient as when you have multiple accounts (I have 3 for work, school, and personal) this does not work well. I resorted to using google for personal stuff and that has helped keep things organized. Individual apps do not work on my PC. When I try to open words PTP or anything else it opens on browser. One drive sucks.(Translated)Having everything in one place has its benefits, such as using both a home PC and a laptop or work computer elsewhere.

C'est vraiment très mal fait.(Translated)I've never seen such a bad app. To connect it took me about fifteen minutes, (3 verifications by email, 2 verifications by phone and at least twenty requests for my password, since the application logs me out every time I press next for checks that do not work).

Microsoft no longer generates product keys for Office installations included with purchase of a PC. But the installation asks for a product key anyway, and stops working. So you pay for a product you don't get. Absolutely never purchase Office from any location other than the Microsoft Store - not even from a reputable PC manufacturer.(Translated)Microsoft no longer generates product keys for Office installations included with purchase of a PC.
